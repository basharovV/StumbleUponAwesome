### Development

Here's some of the things I'd like to build out for this extension. However the main one right now is simply to curate the links as good as I can, add more data sources and make sure the pages are a good mix of interesting, useful, fun and exciting. 

- [ ] Feedback mechanism for good/bad links
- [ ] Favourite 'gems' to bookmark folder
- [ ] Basic stats
- [ ] Categories
  - [x] [awesome curated lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
  - [ ] tech, science, software, startups, etc.

### A note about permissions
This extension requires the `<all_urls>` permission, in order to show the overlay UI on every stumble page that you visit. It does not access data on these sites.
