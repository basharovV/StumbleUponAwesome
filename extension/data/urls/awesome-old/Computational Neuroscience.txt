https://people.sissa.it/~ale/limbo.html,Hippocampal Processing: The aim is to understand how the hippocampus contributes to memory, focusing on modelling coding strategies within each structure of the hippocampal formation (e.g. self-organization of grid representations), as well as interactions between different structures. Neural Basis of Language: The aim is to describe network behaviour that could subserve Language production. A class of reduced Potts models of large semantic associative networks, endowed with adaptation, naturally displays Latching dynamics, i.e. hopping from one attractor to the next. Such dynamics may be associated with a network capacity for infinite recursion, which is considered as the core of several higher cognitive functions.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

https://doellerlab.com/research/,The Doeller and Kaplan group uses neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate brain systems that support learning, memory, and decision making. The former technique boasts relatively good “spatial resolution” (the ability to detect where a signal is coming from) while the latter boasts good “temporal resolution” (the ability to detect when a signal occurs). By combining this data with electrophysiological recordings from rodents, the team is able to paint a more comprehensive picture of the link between entorhinal brain signals and general cognition. ... Our framework is concerned with the key idea that this navigation system in the brain—potentially as a result of evolution—provides a fundamental neural metric for human cognition.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

http://bigbird.psych.purdue.edu/index.html,Our group is studying mental mechanisms (algorithms) involved in cognitive functions. More precisely, we study those cognitive functions that are computationally difficult. A cognitive function is computationally difficult if there is currently no algorithm that can perform this function equally well as the human mind does. This definition includes a lot: perception of shape, motion, color, depth, language understanding, speech recognition, reading, motor control, visuomotor coordination, learning, thinking, problem solving. By studying computationally difficult cognitive functions, we hope to contribute to both: psychology, by understanding cognitive mechanisms, and artificial intelligence, by formulating smart algorithms.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

http://hearlab.ss.uci.edu/,My research interests include human perception, cognition, and mathematical psychology as applied to the perception of complex sounds. Using psychophysical techniques, we study the rules governing low-level auditory processing and the possible mechanisms by which multiple sound sources are segregated. Recent work has been aimed at the development and testing of multiple-channel models of masking that depend on both energetic and temporal aspects of complex sounds. At present, the goal is to extend this work into the realm of perceptual organization, including "auditory streaming" and the detection of a target pattern of sounds against a background of distracter sounds. Both psychophysical experiments and the allied processing models depend on digital signal processing techniques in which acoustical features are independently varied, allowing the determination of the relative contribution of the different cues as well as the underlying combination rules.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

https://sharpelab.psych.ucla.edu/,The lab has a particular interest in how this model building goes awry in schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia are known to exhibit failures in associative learning, characteristically learning to associate events that are not really related or may be irrelevant. This is thought to contribute to the positive symptoms of the disorder, such as hallucinations and delusions, as patients attempt to cognitively rationalize their aberrant learning experience. As a lab, we want to uncover how dysfunction in particular neural circuits contribute to these associative learning deficits, which ultimately lead to positive symptoms of the disorder. The hope is that this work will provide the impetus to develop novel therapeutic compounds targeting these neural circuits to improve quality of life in patients.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

http://neurophysics.huji.ac.il/,Sompolinsky’s research goal is to uncover the fundamental principles of the organization, the dynamics and the function of the brain, viewing the brain through multiscale lenses, spanning the molecular, the cellular, and the circuit levels. To achieve this goal, Sompolinsky has developed new theoretical approaches to computational neuroscience based on the principles and methods of statistical physics, and physics of dynamical and stochastic systems.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

https://www.surlab.org/,The Sur laboratory studies the development, plasticity and dynamics of circuits in the cerebral cortex of the brain. The developing brain requires a genetic blueprint but is also acutely sensitive to experience and the environment. The adult brain responds to external stimuli, and modulates these responses by internal states such as attention, through dynamic changes in information transmission and processing.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html,Current research in our group explores the computational basis of many aspects of human cognition: learning concepts, judging similarity, inferring causal connections, forming perceptual representations, learning word meanings and syntactic principles in natural language, noticing coincidences and predicting the future, inferring the mental states of other people, and constructing intuitive theories of core domains, such as intuitive physics, psychology, biology, or social structure.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience
