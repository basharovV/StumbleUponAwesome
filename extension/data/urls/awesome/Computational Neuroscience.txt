https://doellerlab.com/research/,The Doeller and Kaplan group uses neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate brain systems that support learning, memory, and decision making. The former technique boasts relatively good “spatial resolution” (the ability to detect where a signal is coming from) while the latter boasts good “temporal resolution” (the ability to detect when a signal occurs).

At present, the goal is to extend this work into the realm of perceptual organization, including "auditory streaming" and the detection of a target pattern of sounds against a background of distracter sounds. Both psychophysical experiments and the allied processing models depend on digital signal processing techniques in which acoustical features are independently varied, allowing the determination of the relative contribution of the different cues as well as the underlying combination rules.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

People with schizophrenia are known to exhibit failures in associative learning, characteristically learning to associate events that are not really related or may be irrelevant. This is thought to contribute to the positive symptoms of the disorder, such as hallucinations and delusions, as patients attempt to cognitively rationalize their aberrant learning experience. As a lab, we want to uncover how dysfunction in particular neural circuits contribute to these associative learning deficits, which ultimately lead to positive symptoms of the disorder. The hope is that this work will provide the impetus to develop novel therapeutic compounds targeting these neural circuits to improve quality of life in patients.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

https://parker.lab.uiowa.edu/,My long-term goal is to understand the cerebellar contribution to cognitive and affective processes. In pursuit of this goal, I combine neurophysiology, pharmacology and optogenetics in animals performing behavioral tasks to dissect cerebellar neural circuitry. I study the potential for cerebellar stimulation to rescue cognitive impairments and mood in humans using EEG but also in animals with pharmacologically- and genetically-induced phenotypes of disease. My training in psychology, systems neurophysiology, and clinical psychiatry allows me to target the cerebellum for novel treatments of diseases involving cognitive and affective dysfunction.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience
http://www.cns.caltech.edu/people/faculty/barr.html,A source of motivation and long term goal for the research is the creation of tools for simulation and behavioral prediction of mechanical and biophysical structures. The methods are intended to eventually be applied to simulating the behavior of cellular organelles, but also to self-assembling robotic structures as potentially needed for human colonization of space; the same modeling technology can be used for both applications.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

http://www.neuroscience.umn.edu/people/paul-schrater-phd,My research interests include human and computer vision, planning and guiding reaches with and without visual information, and the integration of visual, haptic, and motor information during the perception-action cycle. My research approach treats problems in vision and motor control as problems of statistical inference, which has led to a concurrent interest in statistical methods that includes Bayesian (Belief) Networks, Dynamic Markov Decision Networks, Pattern Theory, Machine Learning, and other topics in statistics and pattern recognition.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience

http://www.neuroscience.umn.edu/people/sophia-vinogradov-md,Dr. Sophia Vinogradov directs a translational clinical neuroscience laboratory that focuses on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. In collaboration with basic scientists, she studies neuroscience-informed computerized cognitive training exercises for patients with schizophrenia that aim to drive enduring plastic changes in cortical processing. The training programs utilize adaptive algorithms to adjust the difficulty level to maintain a 70-80% correct performance rate, allowing for a customized approach to each individual’s initial performance level and progress rate. Spanning several aspects of cognitive functioning, the exercises fine tune sensory processing speed, working memory, and attention as well as higher-order cognitive processes. In turn, this results in significant improvements in untrained cognitive skills as well as improvements in quality of life.,https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#readme,Computational Neuroscience
